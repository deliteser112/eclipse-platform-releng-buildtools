# This script compares the actual schema in a Cloud SQL database with the golden
# schema in the corresponding release. It detects schema changes made outside
# the normal deployment process, e.g., those made during a troubleshooting
# session that were not cleaned up.
#
# Mounted volumes and required files in them:
# - /secrets/cloud_sql_credential.json: Cloud SQL proxy credential
# - /secrets/schema_deployer_credential.dec the schema_deployer user's
#     database login credential.
# - /schema/schema.jar: the jar with the golden schema.

set -e
read -r cloud_sql_instance db_user db_password \
  <<<$(cat /secrets/schema_deployer_credential.dec | awk '{print $1, $2, $3}')

# Unpack the golden schema from schema.jar
unzip -p /schema/schema.jar sql/schema/nomulus.golden.sql \
  > /schema/nomulus.golden.sql

# Set up connection to the Cloud SQL instance.
# For now we use Cloud SQL Proxy to set up a SSL tunnel to the Cloud SQL
# instance. This has two drawbacks:
# - It starts a background process, which is an anti-pattern in Docker.
# - The main job needs to wait for a while for the proxy to come up.
# We will research for a better long-term solution.
#
# Other options considered:
# - Connect using Socket Factory in this script.
#   * Drawback: need to manage version and transitive dependencies
#     of the postgres-socket-factory jar.
# - Create a self-contained Java application that connects using socket factory
#   * Drawback: Seems an overkill
