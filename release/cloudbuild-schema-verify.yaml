# Verifies that the actual Cloud SQL schema in the environment specified by the
# '_ENV' variable is the same as the golden schema in the current release for
# that environment.
#
# To run the build locally, install cloud-build-local first.
# Then run:
# cloud-build-local --config=cloudbuild-schema-verify.yaml --dryrun=false \
# --substitutions=_ENV=[ENV] ..
#
# To manually trigger a build on GCB, run:
# gcloud builds submit --config=cloudbuild-schema-verify.yaml \
# --substitutions=_ENV=[ENV] ..
#
# To trigger a build automatically, follow the instructions below and add a trigger:
# https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/running-builds/automate-builds
#
# Note that the release process hardens the tags and variables in this file:
# - The 'latest' tag on docker images will be replaced by their image digests.
# - The ${_ENV} pattern will be replaced by the actual environment name.
# Please refer to ./cloudbuild-release.yaml for more details.

# Note 2: to work around issue in Spinnaker's 'Deployment Manifest' stage,
# variable references must avoid the ${var} format. Valid formats include
# $var or ${"${var}"}. This file use the former. Since _ENV is expanded in the
# copies sent to Spinnaker, we preserve the brackets around them for safe
# pattern matching during release. If the invalid ${var} format is used, the
# Spinnaker error message will have the following:
# 'Invalid JSON payload received. Unknown name \"expressionEvaluationSummary\"'
# See https://github.com/spinnaker/spinnaker/issues/3028 for more information.
