Description:
Objectify-Appengine is a thin Java wrapper around Google App Engine's
low-level datastore API that allows you to persist type-safe POJO objects.
It provides a human-friendly query interface, generified key, query, and
prepared query classes, GWT-able entity objects, and transactions in one
lightweight jar file with no dependencies.

Local Modifications:
This library includes custom serializers for AppEngine classes in
com.google.appengine.api.* packages.  This is necessary because serializers are
discovered by AppEngine using a naming pattern that requires that the data and
serializer classes be in the same package (similar to how the Java Beans
introspector finds BeanInfo classes).

In Objectify versions 4.1 and later, the GWT emulation classes were broken
out into a separate versioned jar. Since we are jarjar repackaging the
core Objectify library to include a version number in the package, we need
to include the GWT files in this folder and apply the same changes to them.
